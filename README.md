# Keiro × AI Berkshire

> Value-investing research, powered by a 4-agent parallel team — with web research routed through the [Keiro MCP server](https://kierolabs.space/mcp/api).

This is a Keiro-enabled fork of [`xbtlin/ai-berkshire`](https://github.com/xbtlin/ai-berkshire), a collection of Claude Code skills that simulate a real investment-research team: four agents (business, financial, industry, risk) research a company in parallel, then a Team Lead synthesizes a verdict — Pass / Fail / Gray Zone — in the spirit of Buffett, Munger, Duan Yongping, and Li Lu.

The original skills drive their web research through Claude Code's built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`. **This integration swaps that layer for Keiro's MCP tools** — multi-source deep research, structured single-page extraction, and cited direct answers — so the agents pull decision-grade material instead of "analysis that looks right."

The upstream project is Chinese-first. The investment framework is language-agnostic; see [English output](#english-output) to run it in English without editing the skills. For the full reference — every skill, every tool, the four-master framework, file layout, rate limits — see [`docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md`](docs/PROJECT_GUIDE.md).

## How it works

```
                ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
                │            /investment-team <ticker>         │
                │                   (Team Lead)                │
                └───────┬───────────┬───────────┬──────────────┘

            ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
            │  Keiro MCP server  (registered via .mcp.json)     │
            │  web_search · web_research · extract_url · answer │
            └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The skills' analysis frameworks are **untouched**. Only the web-research transport changes — the smallest diff that survives upstream `git pull --rebase`.

## Tool mapping

| AI Berkshire (original)        | Keiro tool                          | Credits |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|
| `WebSearch` (keywords)         | `mcp__keirolabs__web_search`        | ~1–2    |
| `WebSearch` + `WebFetch` chain | `mcp__keirolabs__web_research`      | ~3–5    |
| `WebFetch` (one URL)           | `mcp__keirolabs__extract_url`       | ~1–3    |
| Repeated searches for one fact | `mcp__keirolabs__answer`            | ~5      |

Per-agent assignment is handled by the preflight skill (see [Setup](#setup)).

## Setup

One command. It creates `.env.keiro` (prompts for your `keiro_` key), injects it into `.mcp.json`, and installs the skills + Keiro preflight into `~/.claude/commands/`.

```bash
./install.sh
```

Get a key (starts with `keiro_`) from the Keiro dashboard → API Keys, then restart Claude Code in this repo so the MCP server loads.

## Usage

```
/keiro-research-preflight        # run once per session — arms agents with Keiro tools
/investment-team <ticker>        # then any upstream skill; agents research via Keiro
```

Other skills work the same way: `/investment-research`, `/industry-funnel`, `/bottleneck-hunter`, `/earnings-team`, `/quality-screen`, `/thesis-tracker`, `/portfolio-review`, … (full list in `skills/`).

---

## English output

The skills instruct agents to write reports in Chinese by default. To get English output without editing 18 skill files, add one line to `CLAUDE.md` under "报告语言与风格":

```
- Language override: when the user asks in English, all reports and agent output switch to English; all other rules unchanged.
```

The Keiro `answer` / `web_research` tools return English by default for English queries, so English sessions need no extra wiring.

## Credits & rate limits

Four agents in parallel = 4× concurrent search volume. Per-tier limits (full table in `keiro-integration/MCP_SERVER.md` or the `get_rate_limits` tool):

| Tool         | Starter  | Pro      | Startup   |
|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| web_search   | 1000/min | 1000/min | 1000/min  |
| web_research | 100/min  | 500/min  | 1000/min  |
| extract_url  | 100/min  | 200/min  | 300/min   |
| answer       | 100/min  | 200/min  | 300/min   |

`web_research` and `extract_url` auto-fallback `deep → medium → light` on upstream 502/503/504/timeout — no manual retry needed.
